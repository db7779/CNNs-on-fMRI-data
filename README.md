# Convolutional Neural Networks for a classification task based on fMRI data
This project is inspired by the paper "fMRI volume classification using a 3D convolutional neural network robust to shifted and scaled neuronal activations" by Hanh Vu et al. The code provides an alternative implementation of the CNNs with tensorflow and Keras API. 

## Sample data is provided and can be downloaded from this link:
